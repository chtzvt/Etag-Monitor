# ETag Monitor 

Simple class for monitoring HTTP ETags (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_ETag)
This is useful to check whether or not changes have been made to a resource.

The only non-stdlib dependency of this class is on python-requests, but most people
have that installed on their system, anyways.
